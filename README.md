# Instagram account sifter

This tool is meant to cross refrence diffrent users followers and followings to find accounts 
that are following one user but not the other. As confusing as that sounds, it has a simple 
endgoal usage. It will give you a rating on how real the account is. This is useful for OSINT
automation. If you have a feeling you have the right account but you want to make sure it is,
use this tool to see what mutuals they have. If they have a lot of mutuals, they are probably 
real and you can use thoes mutals for more OSINT.
